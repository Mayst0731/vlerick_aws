The programme has inspired me in many ways: it gave me insight into very useful new marketing theories and strategies and (something I didn't expect when I enrolled) it boosted my creativity by giving us a behind-the-scenes look at successful campaigns.The programme boosted my confidence too \u2013 because it gave me a framework and tools for developing future campaigns with more efficiency, creativity and audacity. As a result, my plans for the future are much more creative! Now, my outlook on the future is injected with a serious dose of \u2018goesting\u2019 (desire or passion for something): goesting to continue building, goesting to continue inspiring, goesting to continue changing\u2026I would absolutely recommend this programme.

So, I participated in the Pricing programme to gain a better understanding of all cost/pricing aspects in order to fine-tune our product/service proposal. The programme was a revelation to me \u2013 I learned some concepts for modifying our pricing approach and better segmenting our service proposition. I have more confidence now, as the programme has helped me identify the weaknesses in our product/service pricing strategy. I realised that we are ignoring some important potential business segments, because we think they\u2019re out of reach. But working on the cost aspect and adjusting our segmentation is enabling us to broaden our potential market share.In short, we now offer a more affordable basic package, with optional features. This makes our product/service more attractive to a wider customer range.

You can actually learn to change!\"This programme is an immersion in all of the facets of Change Management. In addition to a process-based approach, great attention is paid to the more strategic aspects of 'change'. One of the many eye-openers for me was the discovery that when you try to move too quickly through change processes, and you skip a number of necessary steps, you undermine support for the change and strengthen resistance. Snow only sticks when the ground is already frozen: so you learn to prepare the groundwork and deal with change in all its aspects much more deliberately in the future. This programme gave me the tools and insights \u2013 and a large dose of positive energy \u2013 for working in an ever-changing world. You can actually learn to change",

Our customer value proposition and how we achieve this, is an important element in the formula of a winning strategy. This was an eye-opener for me which was directly applicable in my company. Also, being able to recognise the different cognitive styles in a team is a way to facilitate the change process. These models allow us to shape change projects in our businesses very concretely. We experience daily that the changes process that we are managing get positive recognition from external stakeholders, primarily because of our customers.\"",

The four-day programme really offers you a long term strategy to use as a framework in which to begin a change process. The theoretical framework is there to examine your cognitive style: months later it still gives me time for some introspection at regular intervals. I carefully assess my own approach in a less successful change process before I start judging. That helps me in the \u2018difficult moments\u2019 as a change facilitator.\"",

Above all, I would like to highlight rich exchanges with fascinating speakers (inspiring leaders or experts in their field), as well as dynamic exchanges with my European colleagues from TSOs, DSOs and other companies. The use of case studies illustrated the theory and helped us understand the issues from different perspectives. The programme is a good way to leave the operational world for a moment and immerse myself in a broader vision of the sector's challenges. In addition, I have gained new colleagues and friendships in different European countries. I really enjoyed this programme!\u201d",

The partnership between the Florence School of Regulation and Vlerick Business School brings together the depth of research and the pragmatic approach required for managerial roles. The programme harnesses high-calibre faculty, seasoned experts from European institutions, and inspiring C-suite keynote speakers, and it has helped me broaden my international professional network. It was also a privilege and pleasure to share the 3 modules with a great group of colleagues \u2013 we are hoping to keep this network alive by starting an (informal) alumni association!\u201d",
