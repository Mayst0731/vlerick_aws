When I took on the challenge of the HR Director position at BDO, I needed deeper knowledge of the various HR domains. The Vlerick HRM Executive Master Class looked just right for someone like me. The way the professors encourage interaction and make you think and reflect, and hearing how the other participants (from small SMEs to large organisations) approach certain topics, make the programme especially enriching. Return on investment? We\u2019ve launched projects to improve several core processes and to develop an integrated HR policy in line with BDO\u2019s strategy.

It also gave me the right language for collaborating and problem- solving in organisational environments. I can now better map and measure the state of marketing and propositions internally, and I know how to better assess opportunities closer to clients. My ambitions have also grown considerably, because I now have the knowledge and tools to set more concrete goals.\"",

Providing the customer with the right service at the right price is a key factor for success and differentiation with our competitors. So, I participated in the Pricing programme to gain a better understanding of all cost/pricing aspects in order to fine-tune our product/service proposal. The programme was a revelation to me \u2013 I learned some concepts for modifying our pricing approach and better segmenting our service proposition. I have more confidence now, as the programme has helped me identify the weaknesses in our product/service pricing strategy. I realised that we are ignoring some important potential business segments, because we think they\u2019re out of reach. But working on the cost aspect and adjusting our segmentation is enabling us to broaden our potential market share.In short, we now offer a more affordable basic package, with optional features. This makes our product/service more attractive to a wider customer range. I would definitely recommend this programme: the 3 days provided a cocktail of information, with a pragmatic approach for quick implementation in a real business situation.\u201d",

Interaction with the other participants is extremely valuable: you get the chance to test out solutions on like-minded colleagues, which means that you can return to the workplace with more confidence and apply what you\u2019ve learned immediately. \n\nI have learned important new approaches, especially in terms of managing employees and recognising and appreciating the variety of leadership roles in the organisation. I\u2019m now implementing these things, and I notice that they are already beginning to bear fruit. I\u2019m still in touch with a number of participants \u2212 Vlerick also provides an environment in which you can expand your network in a meaningful way.\u201d",
