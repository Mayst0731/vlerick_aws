Classes are designed to develop participants\u2019 knowledge of concepts and techniques related to cost accounting, the RBM cycle and performance measurement. This course aims to enable participants to diagnose and improve existing RBM systems and to design performance metrics and systems. The course also aims to generate awareness and behavioral skills on how to effectively handle performance assessment systems to orient people and resources towards results.\n\nThis program can be taken as part of the ETGN network (European & Transnational Governance Network).

It requires deep understanding of the context, actors, economics and operational functions. The payer (global donors, national governments and private out-of-pocket) and procurer (supranational, national and sub-national) environment for LMIC markets is complex, heterogeneous across therapeutic categories, and is also rapidly-changing/evolving. Companies find it increasingly difficult to navigate this environment. Global market access teams have to learn new techniques and skills to understand this multi-stakeholder environment. This course brings together a faculty team with vast and rich experience in the theory and practice of access to medicines to help navigate/make decisions to be successful in LMIC markets.\n\u00a0\nWhile grounded in strong theory, the course will use case studies and practical examples as a pedagogical approach. The high profile of the international experts and the faculty involved in the course will ensure a highly interactive and rewarding learning environment.",

        "overview": "Talents assigned to their first leadership roles need to prove themselves to their superiors, peers, and collaborators. Succeeding requires a profound change in both skills and mindset: from a talent who delivers value individually to a leader who creates value through others. Emerging Leaders Program is designed to enable participants to manage this critical transition and realize their full leadership potential.\nIn the first module, participants will develop insights and tools to help them deal with the multifaceted contexts in which leadership plays out while learning how effective leadership requires actively managing upwards, downwards, and laterally. In the second module, participants will reflect on the responsibilities they have accepted as future leaders. Through intense interactions with faculty, peers, and professional actors, they will explore the ethical and psychological foundations of leadership and work on preparing a foundation for their own individual path to leadership.",
