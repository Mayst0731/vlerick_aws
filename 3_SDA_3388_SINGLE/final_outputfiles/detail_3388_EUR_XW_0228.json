This curiosity motivated me to further my career by enrolling in MIHMEP at the SDA Bocconi School of Management; which has been one of the most fulfilling decisions of both my personal and professional life. The structure of MIHMEP allowed me to gain complete insight into all sectors of the healthcare industry, broadening my horizons, while providing me with the opportunity to specialize in one particular field during the third term; I chose Healthcare Management.\nMy section\u2019s international student body, representing over 15 different countries, led to thought-provoking debates and discussions around devising creative solutions to current healthcare challenges at both a local and global level. Working with my colleagues, each with their own diverse perspectives and experience, on case-based projects helped me to further develop the soft skills I needed to excel as a leader in the healthcare industry and successfully manage multidisciplinary teams.\nMIHMEP also provided the opportunity to attend seminars given by industry leaders from top hospitals, think tanks, and global health organizations worldwide. These experiences made me aware of the vast number of current healthcare challenges and ways I could make an impact. These opportunities paired with an effective blend of core courses, case-based learning, and quantitative reasoning makes MIHMEP unique to other Healthcare Masters programs.\nI am now based in Boston, Massachusetts working in Ambulatory Operations at Tufts Medical Center, with a focus in process improvement and project management.",

It means global collaboration, disruptive innovation and sustainable development.As the world\u2019s problems are getting more complex and interrelated,, we need more collaborative tools to make solutions flow across borders and sectors, and more disruptive changes to challenge existing systems. So this August, UNLEASH made Denmark \u201ca festival of disruptions,\u201d where 1000 global participants went through the innovation process of problem-framing, brainstorming, prototyping, testing and pitching, building up more than 200 ideas in 10 days. Moreover, at present my team and I are still scheduling weekly Skype calls to push ideas forward and seek external resources for pilot and implementation and setting up social entrepreneurship across borders.Have you ever done something to make our world a better place?\nI ask myself. As a business student, every day we talk about business strategy and how to drive economic impact in the private sector. But Unleash, makes me reflect on how negligible the social engagement I contributed before and believe how great the social impact one person can bring to the world. After UNLEASH, I am more determined to become one of those role models, to have my voice heard and influence people towards sustainable development goals.Though the event was only 10 days, I am sure the ambition and engagement of 1000 global youth to social progress will be life-long.

                "testimonial_statement": "It was in 2011 that I decided to apply for the MAFED program at SDA Bocconi. After having graduated in international business and having worked in fashion for one year, I wanted to deepen my knowledge about the fashion and luxury industry and expand my horizon regarding opportunities and challenges this industry offers.\nIn 2012, I joined the program and now, one year later I come to the following conclusions.The learning model of MAFED is definitely unique. It is a proper business program but focused entirely on the fashion, experience and design world. Therefore, for people who are interested in exactly that field, MAFED offers a broad experience and unveils a number of possible directions for a future career path. The program helps students to get detailed insights into this creative industry and at the same time provides a strong theoretical business background, which is an absolute must for any industry. The challenges that were faced during MAFED required an open mind for creative ideas as well as managerial and analytical skills.\nFor me personally, it was the ideal combination at that point in time. I had a firm business background but was lacking specific fashion industry related knowledge about processes, business models and different functions within a fashion company. MAFED provided me exactly those additional competencies and a clear overview of the industry that helped define my future career path.\u00a0\nAnother added value was the location. Being based in Milan had several advantages for students. We were constantly exposed to the fashion and luxury world and had the opportunity to compare our knowledge from the classroom, with the real world. The field trips to production sites, stores and showrooms gave us more insights into how the industry works. Milan is the home of many leading international fashion designers and companies. Studying in this environment offered the perfect platform to understand every aspect of this world. And besides that, also outside the classroom, living in Italy definitely has its charm.The proximity to Dolce & Gabbana, Zegna, Tod's and many more well-known fashion companies also had other advantages. Guest speakers visited us frequently from nearly every major fashion brand in Milan, or even Italy. They let us have a look at their daily life as well as the companies' structure. This was a true benefit of the whole MAFED experience. In Q&A's and after-class talks we had the unique chance to get in touch with real professionals and get an idea of their daily routines, challenges and visions. MAFED in general is a program that relies a lot on networking. Therefore, regular alumni events took place in order to let us meet with former students in an informal environment. It was very interesting to see how the lives of MAFED alumni developed after the program, where they ended up, what challenges they had to face and what they would recommend to rookies in the industry. After having graduated myself, I must say that most of what they have said was true and it helped me a lot being warned or encouraged for or against certain decisions.\nThe networking is also a major strength with regards to the class structure. In my class were almost 40 students from about 20 different countries. At first that might sound very exciting, which it definitely is, but it also comprises lots of challenges. Being forced to do many group projects with very different people, gave me an entirely new perspective on intercultural management. Before MAFED I lived abroad and studied with many different people. But being confronted that much with different methods of working, attitudes and habits showed me what it really meant to be open-minded. I admit it was not always easy but looking back I would not want to miss one discussion about punctuality, reliability or commitment. It all helped to shape my perception of different nationalities and showed me how to distinguish between culturally different attitudes and real problems within a team. After one year of MAFED I can now truly say I am able to embrace diversity and identify as well as manage strengths and weaknesses of an international team.\nComing to a conclusion, I believe MAFED is the perfect program for people who are passionate about the industry but still need to learn about its details. MAFED is not really a walk in the park but I can honestly say that every nightshift, every presentation and every exam was worth it. Because for me, in the end it all paid off.\nIn three words I would say MAFED is: very exciting, sometimes exhausting and truly international.",

The combination of Fashion and Business is what I found most appealing. If you add one of the World\u2019s most renowned Business Schools with the passion for fashion which you will only find in Milan, MAFED is the result.What has impressed you most about the SDA Bocconi MAFED?\nThe dedication of the Professors and Teachers, the close ties to the industry and the very international alumni.What didn't you expect from your Master that has positively surprised you?\nI loved to write my business plan. It was a once in a lifetime experience and led to founding of my own brand - LILI RADU. Just recently I launched my second brand. I will always remember the hours I spent in \"the box.\"What kind of impact is the Master having on your life and career?\nAs mentioned above, without MAFED I would probably not have founded my own company, or it would have most probably not been so successful :-).Describe your SDA Bocconi experience and the importance of taking an International Master in Milano, at SDA Bocconi.\nIf you want to work in Fashion, MAFED clearly has to be your first choice. After working in PR and Marketing I wanted to learn more about Fashion. The combination of Fashion and Business knowledge is what makes this program so unique. From day one, I knew that I had made the right choice. I enjoyed and sucked in every little bit of it. Not only did I learn a lot and build the foundation for my own brand but also met a very international and diverse crowd of students who are now very close friends. Today I still feel close to SDA Bocconi and am very proud to be able to hold a lecture from time to time to share my founding experience. I am not exaggerating when I say that MAFED changed my life!",

                "testimonial_statement": "Although less affected by the crisis than other sectors, fashion has also recently had to adopt adaptive strategies. How has it changed, what are its peculiarities and what challenges must it face today?My answer will consider this from the viewpoint of two different experiences: the first Italian, with a luxury company like Valentino, the second American, with Tory Burch, which is a company more orientated to affordable luxury. Despite their marked differences, in many respects their approach was the same. What both companies have done was focus on the product, that is paying more attention to quality, to what customers want, and to the structure of the offering. From the selection of suppliers and the search for new talent, to the care for all of the components (creative and materials), all of which are crucial for the success of a product. It is an effort that I have noticed in all segments of the offer. They have also developed an awareness that \u201cspecialization\u201d is important: a company needs to focus on what they do best and enhance that aspect. This is not only to optimize the quality/price ratio, but also to give credibility to the products: the companies that have been able to keep this promise are those that have survived the crisis and come out stronger. I have in mind a number of examples of companies that succeeded and companies that did not.The crisis has also prompted, inevitably, a radical review of cost structures; not so much the product costs, as the cost of doing business, of management: there were many inefficiencies to address, as well as a lack of skills, for example we needed managers who had both general and sector-specific or product-specific skills. Now there are many high-caliber managers with such skills, and this has brought many positive changes to the companies that recruited them.A further re-orientation that companies have been required to make \u2013 not specifically due to the crisis but because of a structural change in buying habits \u2013 was a new focus on the customer, another strategic change together with the focus on the product. With customers looking to create a rapport that is always more individual. Companies can now learn more about their customers and their shopping experiences through the development of the digital dimension, and from the increasing use of mobile devices. Before there were fewer customers and you needed to focus on those who were spending more and were closer to the brand. Now that we are out of the crisis \u2013 especially in America \u2013 and these digital platforms enable a direct and personalized relationship with a large number of people, companies must invest in these new approaches that, in the end, bring customers to the stores or to the e-commerce channels.Earlier you mentioned to the need for new talent and new skills in this field: how important was your MAFED experience at SDA Bocconi?When I decided to enroll on the MAFED course many years ago, I was coming from the world of finance and consulting, and I had no specific training in this field, only a great interest in it. The Master was a privileged entry point into the world of fashion: had I approached it as a graduate, I would have had to go through a long path, with few opportunities to learn about managerial best practices. Instead, a post-graduate course like MAFED allowed me to merge the financial and consulting competences that I had already acquired with those specific to the fashion and luxury goods industry. Moreover, it is increasingly important for those who approach this field to have a solid foundation in management: I remember that the program had a decidedly intense focus on general management, which provided a broader context for the industry-specific competences.From this point of view, does the fact that MAFED is based in Italy, and in particular Milan, the city of fashion and design, have a particular value on the international labor market and for the students\u2019 own professional development in this area?It has great value for several reasons. The first is almost trivial, because it is difficult to find post-graduate training at the same level in other parts of the world. If we exclude Italy and France, the training available elsewhere in the world is of a much lower level. Another major plus is the proximity to the most important economic areas of the industry. Here in the U.S. there are about a dozen colleges that offer similar training programs, but they are all far from a chain of creation and development, such as Italy\u2019s, and this is a serious drawback.So contact with leading companies in design and fashion really helps the participants of MAFED to enter or re-launch their careers in this sector?Definitely. Bocconi, with its historic integration with the business community, acts as a guarantor to the corporate world, assuring that their students \u2013 under-graduate and post-graduate \u2013 are trained up to the standards required by the industry. But Universit\u00e0 Bocconi and SDA Bocconi are not just a bridge to enterprises: the close collaboration between managers, teachers and consultants has contributed to many businesses developing a culture that promotes innovation, an awareness of the value of management education and the need for young talent.Let\u2019s finish on a personal note: what has MAFED represented to you, on a personal level?I must say straight away that I am a \u201crecidivist\u201d because I was already a Bocconi graduate. Just this morning I saw on facebook a photo of a friend with her baby, who was celebrating his first birthday. This friend of mine is a girl I met 12 years ago at MAFED. Like her, I am still in touch with a good half of the 40 other people I studied with. Some I will meet with from time to time, and not only for business purposes. With everyone, including those who I see less often, there is a deep bond of affection and esteem. Many have been successful in our industry and for many years, in spite of the diaspora that took us to different countries, there has been an ongoing dialogue and mutual sharing of professional advice that has been very helpful. In short, it was a unique experience from a professional point of view but also personally.",

Then end of Jan'21 it was still uncertain if the module can take place in Feb'21. However, Prof. Gabriella Lojacono and her team did an incredible job assuring that our class can travel to the university that felt like a safe place to us. When arriving in Milan I was especially moved by the warm welcome on the first day though Giuseppe Soda, Dean SDA Bocconi, Prof. Gabriella Lojacono and the EMILUX team, as well as Cartier's representation. During the first two days, I was super impressed by the passionate instructors sharing insights into innovative concepts and business strategies of successful luxury companies, and also by inspiring guest speakers on campus and connected online, e.g. Alessandro Varisco, CEO Twinset. Coming from 13 years of experience of digital retail, merchandising and technical product development, I am super excited for the group to double down in building a diverse tool sets required to successfully lead luxury businesses to the next level. Especially the situation of the uncertain developments in the industry driven by the pandemic will require fresh insights. Our EMILUX class '21 is excited to invest into our personal growth with the support of the expertise of SDA Bocconi in luxury segments and businesses. As the first EMILUX class, we will get the chance to generate knowledge into current customer trends, and how luxury brands succeed by efficiently leveraging technological innovations in the context of omni-channel management.

I did some searching and found that EMMS met many of my expectations. Walking into that classroom in Bocconi on our first day, I was met by a pool of diverse and now-familiar faces. We thought we were learning how to be better marketers and salespeople;\u00a0but,\u00a0throughout the pandemic, we learned how to be better humans. EMMS is a great taught program but what sets it apart are the people you meet. I would never have had the opportunity to connect with so many brilliant minds \u2013 professors, peers, and guest speakers \u2013 had I not pursued EMMS. What was supposed to be a 13-month journey became 16 months, which gave us more time to learn from each other and grow as a community. The program directors did an excellent job managing the changing circumstances and I believe that is one of the best parts of the experience \u2013 learning resilience by witnessing it and living through it.\u00a0",
