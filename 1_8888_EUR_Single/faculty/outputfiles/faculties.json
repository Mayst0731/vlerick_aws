        "intro_desc": "Claudia Zeisberger is a Senior Affiliate Professor of Decision Sciences and Entrepreneurship & Family Enterprise at INSEAD, and the Founder and Academic Director of the school\u2019s private equity centre (GPEI).Through the centre\u2019s work, INSEAD has established itself as the go-to source for insights on PE in emerging markets and as an incubator for talent and professionals.Her links to alumni in the venture space were instrumental in the 2015 formation of \u201cINSEAD Alum Ventures (IAV)\u201d, the school\u2019s first dedicated seed fund, by Alumni \u2013 for Alumni.Professor Zeisberger is known for her extensive research on PE in emerging markets, and her output is a function of her close working relationships with private equity firms and their investee companies, institutional investors, Family Offices and Sovereign Wealth Funds.Joining Academia in 2005 after a 16-year career in investment banking & alternative investments, allowed her to leverage her extensive network and combine her passion for education & innovation by connecting academia with industry. In 2010, she launched INSEAD\u2019s popular elective \u201cManaging Corporate Turnarounds,\u201d which combines in-class case studies and visits from industry professionals with an intensive computer-based simulation involving the iconic car brand SAAB and its struggle with bankruptcy. Over a full weekend student teams work to rescue the distressed car manufacturer by drawing on their management, finance and operational skills while facing increasingly complex decisions impacting both the firm\u2019s short-term liquidity and long-term value creation. Students consider MCT the perfect course to put their MBA skills to test; corporations see the simulation as an opportunity to prepare their senior executives for challenging times ahead.Professor Zeisberger teaches the Private Equity & Venture Capital, Corporate Turnaround and Risk management electives in INSEAD\u2019s MBA, EMBA and Executive Education programmes. She has frequently been nominated for the \u201cBest Teaching Award\u201d in her PE elective and has been awarded the \u201cDean\u2019s Commendation for Excellence in MBA Teaching\u201d annually since 2008.Professor Zeisberger is a founding committee member of the Financial Women\u2019s Association (FWA) in Singapore and was previously on the Board of the Singapore Venture Capital Association (SVCA).
