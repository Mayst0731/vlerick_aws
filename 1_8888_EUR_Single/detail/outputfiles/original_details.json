His teaching focuses primarily on firms\u2019 organisational-strategic alignment, leading and experiencing organisational change, managing corporate culture, and utilizing social networks.Noah is interested in social and cultural networks, the antecedents and consequences of creativity and innovation, the production and consumption of culture, and the dynamics of organisational and individual status. His current research is divided among these interests in two streams. The first is around the creation and performance of cultural products: music chart and industry dynamics, what factors contribute to creativity, the tradeoffs associated with being innovative, the implications of the shift to digital distribution, and the analysis of culture using big data. The second area of research is around the role and impact of network- and rankings-based status on organisations. His work, which has garnered him recognition on the Thinkers 50 Radar list, has appeared in Administrative Science Quarterly, computational social science publications, and been covered in Forbes, Quartz.com, The Times of London, and music industry blogs. Prior to becoming a business school academic, Noah had a number of roles in the business and not-for-profit sectors. He was a management consultant for the Monitor Group, working in its strategy practice and its Executive Development group. This was followed by several years as an early member of a start-up in the educational services space. Noah received a joint PhD from the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business and its Sociology department. He also has an MA in Sociology from the University of Chicago and an MBA from Booth, as well as an AB in Psychology from Harvard University. ",

He holds a PhD in Economics from New York University, a Masters in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics, and a Bachelor degree in Economics from Presidency College, Calcutta. Professor Dutt directs the Leading Business Transformation in Asia.Professor Dutt's work lies at the intersection of politics, institutions and international economics. His main research examines how partisan concerns (the political ideology of parties in power) and populist concerns (inequality in income and asset distribution) play an important role in the determination of trade policies. The second stream of his research has a developmental focus and examines the links between institutions and policies. His recent work shows that political instability is very costly in terms of investment and growth, whereas the level of democracy or dictatorship in a country matters much less. A third stream of his research examines the role played by international trade and technological change in accelerating the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers.Professor Dutt\u2019s research has been published in Canadian Journal of Economics, Review of Economics and Statistics, Economic Journal and the Journal of International Economics. He has also contributed to the Oxford Dictionary of Social Sciences where he wrote the entries on Economics.Professor Dutt has worked as an economist at the World Bank's Development Research Group and the Latin American and Caribbean Division, and is currently consulting for the World Bank on a major research project. He has also worked as a fellow at the Ford Foundation, and as a writer and consultant for the Oxford University Press. In addition, he has taught microeconomics, economic development, and international trade and finance to undergraduate, MBA, and PhD participants since 1994. He has won the Best Teacher Award in the INSEAD MBA programme multiple times.",

The careers, futures and even the everyday quality of life of many, depend upon senior leaders\u2019 decisions.While today\u2019s leaders are undoubtedly better informed about what constitutes good leadership than at any other time in history, there is often a gap between what they themselves believe they should be doing, and what they are doing today.Leadership Excellence through Awareness and Practice (LEAP) helps senior leaders bridge this gap. The six-month journey \u2013 comprising three residential modules and individual and group work in between \u2013 focuses only to a limited extent on evidence about successful leadership. Rather, we spend most of our time enabling participants to shift behaviour in the areas that would give their leadership the greatest leverage.The programme is built on the idea that while we know a great deal about what drives effective behaviour, even leaders who are aware of that evidence deviate from such behaviour. Hence we work on making participants aware of thoughts and tendencies, often habitual in nature, which seem to capture them in the moments of decision.Awareness becomes the first step to reprogramming reactions so that new, more effective habits replace the old.",

In 2019 Erin was selected by the Thinkers50 as one of the world\u2019s 50 most influential business thinkers.Living and working in Africa, Europe, and the United States prompted Erin Meyer\u2019s study of the communication patterns and business systems of different parts of the world. Her culture mapping framework allows international executives to pinpoint their leadership preferences and compare their methods to the management styles of other cultures. Erin has taught thousands of executives from 5 continents to decode cross-cultural complexities impacting their work, and to lead more effectively across these differences.Erin has published articles in Harvard Business Review magazine: \u201cBeing the Boss in Brussels, Boston, and Beijing (July 2017), Getting to Si, Ja Oui, Hai and Da (December 2015), When Culture Doesn\u2019t Translate (October 2015,) Navigating the Cultural Minefield (May 2014), and Debunking China Myths (January 2010).

It helped me understand what was right and wrong. For example, I was used to overcommitting because I wasn\u2019t able to say no. Leading for Results helped me to say no. I\u2019ve really grown on a professional and personal level. In fact, the programme came at a time when I was making some major career decisions.

In addition, the 360\u00b0 assessment carried out before the start of the week directly links the programme and theory to the professional reality in which we find ourselves. It is also particularly interesting to follow up the first module with a second (shorter) module after a few weeks\u2019 time, with the aim to pursue the action plan established at the end of the first module. Finally the environment created at INSEAD is such that we are reluctant to leave at the end of the programme\u2026 All this make this programme very appealing. I strongly recommend it!",

Mark Mortensen is co-directing Emerging Leaders in a Digital Age.His area of expertise is organisational collaboration, with an emphasis on two increasingly prevalent ways of organisng that do not fit traditional models of team dynamics: globally distributed (virtual) and project-based work. In his research, he has investigated the nature of conflict in distributed collaborations and its relationship to identity, context, and communication; the impact of dispersion structure \u2013 in the form of balance, imbalance, and isolation \u2013 on collaboration dynamics; and the effects of first-hand experience \u2013 gained through site visits and expatriate assignments \u2013 on trust. He has also explored the interpersonal effects of working in multiple, partially-overlapping, fluidly-shifting projects, developing a fundamentally new model of collaboration. Professor Mortensen's research has been recognised by the academic community through awards including the William H. Newman Award, Organisational Behaviour Division Best Dissertation-Based Paper Award, and Runner-up OCIS Division Best Paper Award from the Academy of Management; and the Best Paper Award Finalist nomination by the Interdisciplinary Network of Groups Researchers.

The better you understand your own personal communication style and how it impacts others, the greater your chance of articulating your organisation\u2019s strategic vision, inspiring high performance and creating positive working relationships based on vibrant interaction and listening.Building effective communication skills becomes even more important in today\u2019s rapidly changing business landscape, where technological disruption is leading to increased volatility and uncertainty. Leaders can help their people navigate the complexities of the digital age and make meaning in this change. Leadership communication capabilities that foster meaningful collaboration, interaction and engagement are must-have skills for executives today.Leadership Communication with Impact is an online programme designed to help leaders improve their impact, performance and effectiveness as communicators.

These features can change what businesses and the managers in them do but also how they do it in profound ways.The effects of AI will only be magnified in the coming decade, as industries transform their core processes and business models to take advantage of its capabilities. Rather than miss the momentum, business leaders need to understand and act on the tremendous opportunities AI offers their industry. They need to consider what is possible now, what will be possible, and what other industries are doing that could translate to their business to give them a competitive advantage.AI for Business is designed to give managers an understanding of the growing deployment of AI in business, so they can appreciate what it can and cannot do for their organisation.The programme also provides practical templates to guide how you work with data scientists and programmers in your organisation in making the most of these emerging technologies. Uniquely, it also features hands-on sessions where you will be shown how to commission analysis and analyse the results that data scientists produce.AI for Business is delivered over three\u00a0immersive days\u00a0by faculty members at the forefront of applying AI-based techniques in areas such as marketing, finance and organisation design.",

        "overview": "In the last decade, digital has become part of almost every debate and discussion around strategy and often, the central focus. The reason is simple.Powerful and interconnected technologies today including the cloud and AI, mean any business going through a digital transformation journey will be handed lucrative opportunities, but will also have to face dramatic threats.The possibilities for new products, services and business models promise to substantially impact almost every sector of the economy even those where digital has already brought important changes.And yet, although the long-term impacts of digital promise to be deep and far reaching, the path to this future for industries, companies and consumers is proving far from linear or predictable. Often claims of impending disruptions do not materialise, at least in the time frame or manner predicted. A carefully considered, strategic response is invaluable in approaching digital transformation so that your business remains sustainable and agile in this ever-changing environment.Strategy in the Age of Digital Disruption provides the strategic tools, concepts and perspectives that will allow you to develop a strategic response to the new digital possibilities and to then align your organisation for effective strategy execution. It will support you in becoming more proactive in the digital domain, help you turn digital threats into opportunities, and allow you to leverage digital to create competitive advantage and enhanced performance.",

On a personal level, I really enjoyed the many engaging videos and case studies that Professor Zemsky shared with us. I was surprised at how engaging an online course with no face-to-face interaction could be and would definitely recommend it to anyone. The flexibility in doing an online course is what originally attracted me and it has enabled me to juggle my busy job and family life, and still be very active throughout the course. I think that the pace and the cadence required in the course forces you to stay on top of the learning curriculum which ultimately would contribute to the high level of engagement by all course participants.

The programme focuses on the people, process, and philosophy of innovative companies to help you develop your ability to innovate by generating more ideas and putting them into action. It explores the behaviours of innovation leaders, and subsequently the process of how innovators turn their ideas into reality. It also explains how leaders and organisations adapt their culture, structure and processes to make room for innovation. These insights are based on research of more than 400 businesses, including the world\u2019s most innovative companies.More specifically, the programme offers insights into ideation, design thinking, agile methodologies, and business model innovation. However, rather than offering these as fragmented approaches, this programme integrates these disparate frameworks into a single, end-to-end framework for testing innovative ideas, and enables you to understand how an organisation that is defined by and developed around execution can adapt itself to foster and drive innovation.Whether you are caught in the middle of digital (or other) disruption, or you want to innovate within your organisation, Innovation in the Age of Disruption will provide you with a comprehensive set of tools to adapt to today\u2019s VUCA world.",

It will challenge their thinking and help them gain a holistic\u00a0perspective of business operations across multiple Asian countries.

His current research is divided among these interests in two streams. The first is around the creation and performance of cultural products: music chart and industry dynamics, what factors contribute to creativity, the tradeoffs associated with being innovative, the implications of the shift to digital distribution, and the analysis of culture using big data. The second area of research is around the role and impact of network- and rankings-based status on organisations. His work, which has garnered him recognition on the Thinkers 50 Radar list, has appeared in Administrative Science Quarterly, computational social science publications, and been covered in Forbes, Quartz.com, The Times of London, and music industry blogs. Prior to becoming a business school academic, Noah had a number of roles in the business and not-for-profit sectors. He was a management consultant for the Monitor Group, working in its strategy practice and its Executive Development group.
