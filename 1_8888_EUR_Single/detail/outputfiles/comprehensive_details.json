It provides a forum for you to learn, reflect and grow.

Considering the amount of communication undertaken by senior business leaders, the CEO might equally be called a chief \u201cexplanation, engagement or enlightenment\u201d officer. Effective leaders understand that if their message does not resonate deeply with their target audience, speaking to emotions, aspirations and needs, then likely it will not be understood \u2013 much less championed.Put simply, effective communication is an essential component of professional success. The better you understand your own personal communication style and how it impacts others, the greater your chance of articulating your organisation\u2019s strategic vision, inspiring high performance and creating positive working relationships based on vibrant interaction and listening.Building effective communication skills becomes even more important in today\u2019s rapidly changing business landscape, where technological disruption is leading to increased volatility and uncertainty. Leaders can help their people navigate the complexities of the digital age and make meaning in this change. Leadership communication capabilities that foster meaningful collaboration, interaction and engagement are must-have skills for executives today.Leadership Communication with Impact is an online programme designed to help leaders improve their impact, performance and effectiveness as communicators. The aim is to equip you - as leaders - with the tools, techniques and skills you need to build your communication capacity at all levels \u2013 whether it be interpersonal, organisational or external, and enabling\u00a0you to become a leader communicator who connects and resonates with any stakeholder.This programme shows you how to develop your own leadership communication style \u2013 to maximise your potential strengths \u2013 and close the gaps. You will establish a link between leadership, different communication styles and performance results \u2013 in the process discovering more about yourself and how your behaviour affects others. You will also learn how to use emotional intelligence through interpersonal communication and how to encourage strategic thinking through asking questions, developing ideas and articulating clear goals.",

        "overview": "In a digitised environment characterised by rapid and continual disruption, it is critical for organisations to be agile and quickly respond to change. As a result, businesses require leaders who are not only effective interpersonally, but who can also manage increasingly complex organisations.Effective leaders today must be able to make decisions faster and lead change efficiently, while skilfully influencing in a more interconnected, collaborative landscape. Additionally, they need to foster a \u201cdigital-ready\u201d organisational culture that embraces \u2013 rather than resists \u2013 continuous change.Leading Organisations in Disruptive Times is an online programme that takes a closer look at the challenges facing senior leaders today\u2013 from conducting fair decision-making processes to enabling their organisations to navigate wider political and cultural challenges.Building on cutting-edge research, the programme will develop your ability to drive faster decision-making, accelerate change processes, and cut through difficult cultural challenges. It will provide you with a set of concepts and tools enabling you to lead your organisation with impact and efficiency \u2013 maximising its performance in changing times.",

        "overview": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as the most important and transformative technology of our time. Recent advances, particularly in machine learning - a computer\u2019s ability to improve\u00a0its performance without human instruction -\u00a0have led to a rapid proliferation of new applications that are changing the game for companies in almost all industries.\u00a0AI can help accomplish many business activities with greater accuracy and at a fraction of the time it would take humans to do the same.AI also offers a substitute for human judgement because it can forecast based on patterns in data that are undetectable by humans. These features can change what businesses and the managers in them do but also how they do it in profound ways.The effects of AI will only be magnified in the coming decade, as industries transform their core processes and business models to take advantage of its capabilities. Rather than miss the momentum, business leaders need to understand and act on the tremendous opportunities AI offers their industry. They need to consider what is possible now, what will be possible, and what other industries are doing that could translate to their business to give them a competitive advantage.AI for Business is designed to give managers an understanding of the growing deployment of AI in business, so they can appreciate what it can and cannot do for their organisation.The programme also provides practical templates to guide how you work with data scientists and programmers in your organisation in making the most of these emerging technologies. Uniquely, it also features hands-on sessions where you will be shown how to commission analysis and analyse the results that data scientists produce.AI for Business is delivered over three\u00a0immersive days\u00a0by faculty members at the forefront of applying AI-based techniques in areas such as marketing, finance and organisation design.",

        "overview": "In the last decade, digital has become part of almost every debate and discussion around strategy and often, the central focus. The reason is simple.Powerful and interconnected technologies today including the cloud and AI, mean any business going through a digital transformation journey will be handed lucrative opportunities, but will also have to face dramatic threats.The possibilities for new products, services and business models promise to substantially impact almost every sector of the economy even those where digital has already brought important changes.And yet, although the long-term impacts of digital promise to be deep and far reaching, the path to this future for industries, companies and consumers is proving far from linear or predictable. Often claims of impending disruptions do not materialise, at least in the time frame or manner predicted. A carefully considered, strategic response is invaluable in approaching digital transformation so that your business remains sustainable and agile in this ever-changing environment.Strategy in the Age of Digital Disruption provides the strategic tools, concepts and perspectives that will allow you to develop a strategic response to the new digital possibilities and to then align your organisation for effective strategy execution. It will support you in becoming more proactive in the digital domain, help you turn digital threats into opportunities, and allow you to leverage digital to create competitive advantage and enhanced performance.",

        "overview": "Innovation in the Age of Disruption is an online programme that enables you to understand how to leverage innovation to respond to change, particularly change driven by digital transformation. The programme focuses on the people, process, and philosophy of innovative companies to help you develop your ability to innovate by generating more ideas and putting them into action. It explores the behaviours of innovation leaders, and subsequently the process of how innovators turn their ideas into reality. It also explains how leaders and organisations adapt their culture, structure and processes to make room for innovation. These insights are based on research of more than 400 businesses, including the world\u2019s most innovative companies.More specifically, the programme offers insights into ideation, design thinking, agile methodologies, and business model innovation. However, rather than offering these as fragmented approaches, this programme integrates these disparate frameworks into a single, end-to-end framework for testing innovative ideas, and enables you to understand how an organisation that is defined by and developed around execution can adapt itself to foster and drive innovation.Whether you are caught in the middle of digital (or other) disruption, or you want to innovate within your organisation, Innovation in the Age of Disruption will provide you with a comprehensive set of tools to adapt to today\u2019s VUCA world.",

The programme will help you understand how a company\u2019s strategic agenda can evolve, and how you can use that understanding to better identify opportunities for profitable differentiation.

As companies become more product-led and product-centric, Chief Product Officers and other executive product roles are appearing and rising in prominence. At this level, strong leadership skills are critical to the success of the individual, team, and organisation, and oftentimes, people don\u2019t realise the impact their leadership style can have on themselves and others. As more product managers reach the executive ranks, they and their companies are recognising the need for accelerated development in this area.To begin the process of honing executive-level product management skills, the Product Management Festival (PMF), an organisation dedicated to the development of product managers,\u00a0and INSEAD, have partnered to develop the Product Management Executive Programme. It provides current and rising PM executives with the tools, knowledge\u00a0and know-how to lead effectively and to amplify their impact in the organisation.The Product Management Executive Programme is designed to provide attendees with opportunities to deepen their understanding of leadership\u00a0and to develop their capacity to exercise it effectively and responsibly, while also providing a balance of PM-focused sessions. It will be led in tandem by INSEAD faculty and product executives from leading technology companies, providing strategic insights from the field and skills that will be critical to your success. The leadership and PM content is intertwined to reflect the many demands PM executives face.",
